# week-one-challenge

## Description

In this week's challenge for the UCI coding bootcamp, it was the objective to refactor the given starter code to make it more accessible. The 
starter code lacked semantic elements and thus could be difficult to conceptualize at first glance. Additional steps were taken to enhance SEO,
which is the primary focus of the orginazation. This was done through the use of image alt attributes. 

## Credits
The starter code was received from my class repository to which all the edits were made.
